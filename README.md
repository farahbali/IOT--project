This React Native Firebase starter contains a few key features that all apps backed by Fireabase support:

## Getting Started (with Expo)

```
git clone https://github.com/instamobile/react-native-firebase.git
cd react-native-firebase
npm install
npx expo start
```

## Getting Started (without Expo)

If you prefer using React Native CLI, you'll need to eject from Expo first:

```
git clone https://github.com/instamobile/react-native-firebase.git
cd react-native-firebase
npx expo prebuild
npm install
react-native run-android // react-native run-ios
```

This React Native Firebase starter is built with Firebase Web SDK, which makes it compatible with both Expo CLI and React Native CLI.
